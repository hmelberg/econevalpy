# econevalpy

`econevalpy` is a Python library aimed at providing tools for health economic evaluations. The initial focus is on implementing decision tree models, with future plans to incorporate Markov models, agent-based simulations, and a user-friendly web interface.

## Core Goals

*   **Model Agnostic Engine:** Separate the calculation engine from the model description.
*   **Text-Based Model Definition:** Allow users to define models using a simple text-based syntax.
*   **Object-Oriented Design:** Import text-based models into Python classes with methods for various economic evaluations.
*   **Comprehensive Analysis:** Support calculations such as incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs), probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA), and cost-effectiveness acceptability curves (CEACs).

## Current Focus: Decision Trees (Python)

The immediate development priority is to build the core functionality for creating, defining, and evaluating decision trees in Python.

## Future Roadmap

*   Markov Models
*   Agent-Based Simulations
*   R library with similar features
*   Web interface for model building and analysis
*   Graphical User Interface (GUI) for model development
